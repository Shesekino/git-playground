# git-playground
a short-lived repository for some git training

# scenarios we will try to master
- start working on a new branch (clone, fetch, checkout -b, reset --hard)
- preparing a WIP commit (add, reset, diff, diff --cached, push, push -u)
- moving between branches (stash & stash pop, checkout, log)
- resolving conflicts (rebase)
- preparing a PR-worthy branch from a collection of WIP commits (rebase -i, reset, push -f, commit --amend)
- cleanup (branch -D)

# bonus scenarios (we probably won't need these)
- cherry-picking
- setting branch upstream
- someone `push -f`ed into a shared branch
- multiple commits on the same file
- checking out a file from a different branch
- deleting a remote branch
